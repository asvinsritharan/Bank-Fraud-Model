# Bank-Fraud-Model
This is a report on fraud detection and how to create a model to detect fraudulent transactions. A decision tree was ultimately the best solution using a dataset obtained from Kaggle. Data analysis was done to determine the best variables for the model and precision, recall and f1 scores were used to choose the best model.
