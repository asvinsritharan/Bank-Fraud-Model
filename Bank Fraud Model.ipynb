    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "A bank experiences fraud often on a regular basis. It is important that the bank is able to recognize fraud when it occurs. This prevents headaches for the customer as it avoids them unknowingly paying for the fraudulent transaction. Automatic fraud detection minimizes downtime for the customer as the bank handles the fraud and issues a new card to the customer automatically instead of having the customer find a fraudulent transaction, contact the bank, dispute the charge and request a new card. The idea of automatic fraud detection also builds a stronger bond between the customer and the bank, thus both the bank and the customer benefit from the detection of fraud.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The merchant, area, amount of the transaction are all possible factors which can help detect fraud. This project seeks to determine the factors which determine whether or not a transaction is fraudulent. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Interest\n",
    "\n",
    "The interested party in this problem would be a bank. Fraud detection can help a bank block transactions which appear fraudulent thus alleviating much of the downtime a customer faces dealing with a false transaction."

    "# Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on our description of the problem it is important that we get merchant information, customer name, category of the transaction, area in which the transaction took place and the amount of the transaction. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to obtain this information, a [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/kartik2112/fraud-detection?select=fraudTrain.csv) will be used to train and test the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains columns: transaction date and times, credit card numbers, merchant, category, amount, first name, last name, gender, street name, city name, state, zipcode, latitude of customer, longitude of customer, city population, job of customer, date of birth, transaction number, unix time, merchant longitude and latitude, and fraud label. We must first drop columns which are redundant or appear in other forms. An example of such columns are the transaction date and times and unix time. Unix time is equivalent to transaction date and time so we only need to keep one. \n",
    "\n",
    "After the relevant variables are gathered, we then plot the variables against the fraud labels to determine if they have any influence on whether or not a transaction is fraud. Dropping the irrelevant variables here, give us a more rigid set of variables which we can then use for training our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data then needs its categorical variables factorized so they can be used in models. Once it's all done, the data will be normalized so variables don't have more influence over others in the model. Finally, the Decision Trees, KNN, SVM and Logistic Regression models will be created using the data and the test data will be made using 10% of the dataset. The model with the highest recall score will then be the model selected as our fraud detection model."

    "# Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal of this project is to successfully predict the transactions which are fraudulent. To do this, we must have as many cases of fraud as possible to train our data. Our dataset has been pre split with training and testing data, however we will merge the data into one dataset and split it afterwards so we can ensure a random split for training and testing data. We will then perform data analysis on our dataset to determine the importance of having certain variables in our dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will plot categorical variables against fraud categorical variable by using bar charts to compare shapes to see if there are differences in distribution. Side by side boxplots will be used to plot quantitative variables against the fraud categorical variable to see differences in distribution of data. Variables which are variations of other variables, have no variation in fraudulent transactions or are insignification will be excluded from the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "After the unnecessary variables are dropped from our dataset, we factorize the categorical variables to give categories a numerical representation so that they can be modelled on. Normalization will take place so variables like zip codes, which have large number values, don't have higher impact on our model than other variables like category of purchase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, since this is a classification problem, we will build a model using decision trees, KNN, SVM and logistic regression for fraud detection. Each model will then be tested by calculating it's precision, recall and f1-scores. It is important to note that since this is a fraud detection model, we want to be able to correctly label as many of the fraud cases as possible. This means we will be focusing on finding a model with the highest recall score that we can obtain as a high recall score indicates we are able to correctly predict a high amount of actual fraud transactions."

We will then balance the training data so that there is not bias in prediction towards non fraud cases, but we will leave the test data as is so that it imitates real life. Afterwards we will preprocess our data so that all the values are normalized. We do this because values like zipcodes have very high values which when left unnormalized, can result in heavier weight in zipcode over other variables."

Then we dropped all other variables and factorized the categorical variables so that they can be used in fitting and testing for our models. A range of values were used in our decision tree and knn models for the number of trees and K neighbours respectively. An SVM and Logistic Regresion model was also created for the data but ultimately the decision tree with 10 trees was the most successful model.\n",

    "The decision tree was able to give us a precision score of 0.80 and a recall score of 0.65. The model was able to correctly label 80% of transactions it labelled as fraud, and it was able to correctly identify 65% of all fraud cases. All other models were significantly worse in recall scores and slightly worse in precision scores. This implies that the other cases were able to correctly identify the cases it labelled as fraud, but was not able to label many as fraud in the first place. Our decision tree was the only model which was able to get a decent value for it's recall score."

    "The importance of recall in our situation is that a bank should be able to correctly identify a high percentage of all fraudulent transactions made. It is not enough for a bank to simply correctly label a small percentage of all fraudulent cases. The risk of not being able to predict a high percentage of all fraudulent transactions is bad for the customer as it does not alleviate the risk that the solution was intented to fix in the first place.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that a recall score of 0.65 is not nearly reliable enough to implement into a bank model. Thus it is important to gain additional transaction information to strenghthen this model so it will be able to detect a higher percentage of fraudulent transactions. Additional data could include, customer id so that other cards linked to the customer can be used to determine fraud in high risk customers and average spending amount to detect unusual transactions. Additional information would be greatly beneficial as more variables in the model can significantly improve the accuracy of our model thus bringing greater security to customers."

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this project was to be able to create a model which would be able to correctly label fraudulent transactions as fraud. Our best model, a decision tree of depth of 9, was able to give us 80% accuracy in it's labelling when it labelled a transaction as fraud, and it was able to correctly identify 65% of all fraudulent transactions. Our model was undoubtably limited by different variables available to us in our dataset, however, it still managed to give decently accurate predicitions. Additional variables in our dataset would have given us an opportunity to add more reliability to our model, hopefully increasing our recall score. This model is helpful to banks as it allows banks to reasonably predict transactions which could be fraudulent, improving their relationship with their customers and instilling a sense of confidence in the bank."
